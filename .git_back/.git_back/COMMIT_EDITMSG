significantly
  streamlined by removing:
  - 🗑️ release_advice.py (400+ lines of overengineering)
  - 🗑️ decision_api.py (300+ lines of parallel systems)
  - 🗑️ git_tracker.py (500+ lines redundant with GitSensor)

  The remaining code follows the clean sensors → Ψ → Φ → Ω → actions flow without
  bypass systems or overengineering.
